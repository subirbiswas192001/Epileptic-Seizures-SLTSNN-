# # 🧠 Epileptic Seizure Detection using SLT and SNN

### 🚀 Overview  
Epileptic seizures cause sudden disturbances in brain activity, leading to disrupted brain function. Early detection and diagnosis are crucial for effective treatment and management of seizures. This repository introduces a novel **SLTSNN hybrid model** that integrates:  
- **Slantlet Transform (SLT)** for advanced EEG signal processing.  
- **Spiking Neural Network (SNN)** using Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neurons.  

This model leverages EEG signals and provides superior detection accuracy, offering a robust solution for epileptic seizure analysis on imbalanced datasets.

### 🗂 Features  
- 🧪 **Signal Processing with SLT**:  
  Extracts multiple linear components for better feature representation of EEG signals.  

- 🧠 **Hybrid SLTSNN Model**:  
  Combines SLT with SNN for enhanced detection potential.  

- 📊 **Performance Metrics**:  
  Achieves exceptional results with imbalanced datasets:  
  - **Precision**: `0.98`  
  - **Recall**: `0.98`  
  - **F1-score**: `0.96`  
  - **Accuracy**: `0.98`
